What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software.

Software engineering includes the entire process of software development, from initial concept to maintenance, whereas traditional programming focuses mainly on writing code.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Planning: This initial phase involves determining the scope of the project, defining the objectives, conducting feasibility studies, and establishing a project plan. It sets the foundation for the entire development process.

Requirement Analysis: This includes understanding the needs and expectations of users, and any specifications that the software must meet.

Design: The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software. The goal is to establish how the software will work and how different components will interact.

Implementation (Coding):
During this phase, the actual code for the software is written based on the outcome of the previous phase. Developers use programming languages and tools to create the software's functionality.

Testing: Once the code is developed, it undergoes thorough testing to identify and fix any defects or bugs. 

Deployment: This involves releasing the software to users.This might be uploading a mobile app to the App Store and making it available for download or to the web.

Maintenance: Any bugs identified are fixed, and updates or enhancements are made as needed. This phase ensures the software continues to function correctly and meets evolving user needs.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models

1. Agile adapts to changes easily, Waterfall does not.

2. Waterfall relies heavily on documentation, Agile focuses on working software.

3. Agile involves customers throughout the process, Waterfall usually does not.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirement Engineering is the  process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements.

The importance include:

1. Clarity: Ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the software should do.

2. Foundation: Provides a basis for system design and implementation.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down or dividing a software system into smaller, manageable, and independent modules or components.

1. It improves maintainability and scalabilily as it is easier to read and understand.

2. It also makes debugging easier.Modules or components can be reused in other projects.

3. It improves performance as it is easy to integrate third party components or new modules.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

LEVELS OF SOFTWARE TESTING

Unit Testing: This involves testing individual components or functions, making sure that each of the components work well

Integration Testing:this involves testing combined parts of the system making sure that the different parts work together.

System Testing: This involves testing the whole system as a whole, making sure that the system functions properly

Acceptance Testing: this involves checking if the system or application meets the users need

Importance of Testing in Software Development

1. It make sure that the application meets the user need thereby building trust

2. It also reduce cost as it reduces the bugs to fix after post-deployment

3. It also enhance security as testing exposes vulnerabilty and possible security threats

4. it ensure that application functions well


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are tools that help manage changes to source code over time.

Importance:

1. They give room for collaboration as many developers can work on the same project

2. It prevent data loss

3. With this tool, it is possible to go back to the previous version if needed

Examples include Git, SVN

1. Git: It is popular for its features like branches and pull requests.

2. SVN (Subversion) : It is known as a centralized version control, known for simplicity and ease of use.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Roles of a Software Project Manager

1. Planning: Define project scope, timelines, and resources.

2. Execution: Oversee development and manage teams

3. Monitoring: Track progress, manage risks, and adjust plans as needed.

4. Delivery: Ensure the project is completed on time and within budget.

Challenges faced by Software Project Manager

Resource Allocation: Ensuring the right resources are available when needed.

Communication: Keeping stakeholders informed and engaged.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software Maintenance is the process of updating and improving software after its deployment or release.

Types of maintenance activities

1. Corrective: This involves fixing bugs and errors.

2. Adaptive: This involves updating software to work in new environments or OS.

3. Preventive: This involves making changes to prevent future issues.

Importance of Software Maintenance

1. Ensures the software continues to meet user needs.

2. Extends the softwareâ€™s useful life due to adaptive maintanance

3. Enhances the software's performance and security.

4. What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues include:

1. Privacy: Protecting user data from unauthorized access.

2. Security: Ensuring software is secure and free from vulnerabilities.

3. Ensuring software does not cause harm.

How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

1. Transparency: Being truthful and honest about software functions and limitations.

2. Staying informed about ethical practices and new regulations

3. Follow Guidelines: Adhering to codes of conduct.
